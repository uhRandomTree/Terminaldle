- ~~Add a keyboard visualization to show what letters haven't been used and such.~~
- ~~Add the hard mode present on real Wordle.~~
- ~~Consolidate the `UpdateIDs.py` into `WORDLE.PY`, or make a way to share functions and data between them. (A lot of `UpdateIDs.py` is copied from `WORDLE.PY` and just takes up space.)~~
- ~~Link the https://www.nytimes.com/YYYY/MM/DD/crosswords/wordle-review-GAME#.html somewhere for easy access.~~
- ~~Maybe create a `--links` argument that displays all of the links relevant (like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/crosswords/best-wordle-tips.html) and the [original](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and maybe the subscribe page out of kindness.~~
- ~~High contrast mode, 16 colour mode, etc.~~
- ~~Pass and play mode.~~
- ~~"Marathon" mode, where the final guess becomes the next word's starting guess, and number of games played is counted. Probably reccomended to reduce to 5 or fewer attempts.~~
- ~~Update links "page".~~
- Update this things main page lol. Images! Images galore!
- Add starting splash screen.
- TUI
- Add a seperate script for helping solve it (a solution bot, if you will, that has different options of helpfulness).
- Optimize/compress word data.
